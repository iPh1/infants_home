# problem
## external
sector in crisis (==Early Childhood Australia, 2022 National Survey==)

* nation-wide workforce shortage; ***why?***
* staff:
	* under pressure
	* burnt out
	* under paid
	* under valued
## staff
* staff requesting extended leave

* lots of roles for early childhood teachers - unfilled
## logistics/business
* high staff turnover (30% compared to historic <20%)

* increased reliance on agency casuals - expensive
	* opportunity: experienced seniors have experinece with classroom, children and parents
		* they carry more of the workload than a. casuals

* ‚≠ê recruitment challenges - salary, conditions
	* unable to meet requests - flexible working conditions, high salaries (esp. undergrad)
		* havent budgeted for increases (charity)
	* 11hr day shift for long day care centres - too long for new staff
	* demands too high - short shifts, flexible working hrs, work school times
		* inequity, roster issues, compliance concers
	* strict pre employment checks
		* high, strict values for entry - premium positioning

* remuneration - above award rates
	* **gap narrowing**, unable to pay above average grade
* "budgetted for the increase"
## govt/economic policies
* competition with education sector - govt. trying to divert employement towards primary education and not ecec (infants chome)

* competition w/ **commercial childcare centres** - better budgets and size = higher renumeration, benefits;
	* *"perceived to be better"* ‚Üê bold claim lol

* staff
	* **international visas** (reduced working hours)
	* huge responsibilities (negligence, misconduct etc.)
	* long commute time (geographically dispersed - working closure from home)

* govt. policies post covid-19: rush to push people through training ‚Üí ‚Üëquantity but ‚Üí ‚Üìquality

vacanies

## donations
* donations fell significantly after/around covid periods

# solution must involve:

* wellbeing
* work/life balance
* recognition for out eductors and teachers

* a solution that is: low cost, high impact

* staff retention; they like
	* teamwork/collaboration
	* renumeration
	* flexibility

> all burnt out and feeling underappreciated

* being paid more than they're worth

# consider

* status as **charity**
	* they can't spend limited funds for cruises and other stuff

tntt

* volunteering programs are hard

competition e.g. guardian - why they're doing so well 
* larger?
* value offering?
* better renumeration?
* better staff benefits?

* better learning/experience?
